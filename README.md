# Hi there 👋

I'm [Hoshikoooo], a passionate self-taught developer from [India]. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

・👨‍💻 I’m an aspiring software developer with a strong focus on Python and Java.
