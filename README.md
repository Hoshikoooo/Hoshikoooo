# Hi there 👋

I'm [Hoshikoooo], a passionate self-taught developer from [India]. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

・👨‍💻 I’m an aspiring software developer with a strong focus on Python and Java.

・🤖 Passionate about Discord bot development, I enjoy creating automated solutions to enhance community engagement and streamline server management.

・💡 Currently exploring APIs, automation, and building interactive bots with Discord.py while also learning Java for broader application development.

・📚 Always eager to learn new technologies, improve my coding skills, and contribute to open-source projects.
